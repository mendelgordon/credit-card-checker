You can use this to check if a credit card number is valid.
It's using the Luhn algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) to check if the number is valid.
Calling the validate function in main.js with a credit card number in a string will return true if the number is valid, false otherwise.
