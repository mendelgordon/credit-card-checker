# Credit-Card-Checker-Validatior In js With Comments
 #### How to use it
 You can use this to check if a credit card number is valid.
It's using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) to check if the number is valid.
Calling the validate function in main.js with a credit card number in a string will return true if the number is valid, false otherwise.<br>
